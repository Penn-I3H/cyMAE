# cymae_application

I put `MDIPA_DORA_002_3MO_Processed.fcs` in `./service/data/input` directory as a test file.

If `Dockerfile` works properly, `MDIPA_DORA_002_3MO_Processed_cymae.json` file, which contains a list of predicted cell type for each cell by cyMAE, will be created in `./service/data/output` directory.
